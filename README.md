# Spark Developer Certification - Comprehensive Study Guide (python)
## What is this? <br>
While studying for the [Spark certification exam](https://academy.databricks.com/exam/crt020-python) and going through various resources available online, [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdrakiburrahman/) thought it'd be worthwhile to put together a comprehensive knowledge dump that covers the entire syllabus end-to-end, serving as a Study Guide for myself and hopefully others. <br>

Note that I used inspiration from the [Spark Code Review guide](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/3249544772526824/521888783067570/7123846766950497/latest.html) - but whereas that covers a subset of the coding aspects only, I aimed for this to be more of a *comprehensive, one stop resource geared towards passing the exam*.
